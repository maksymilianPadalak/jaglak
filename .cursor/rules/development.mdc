# Development Rules

## Git Workflow

- **NEVER commit or push changes unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Only commit when the user explicitly requests it (e.g., "commit and push", "commit these changes")
- Do not automatically commit changes, even if they seem complete or working

## OpenAI API Usage

- **ALWAYS use the Responses API** (`client.responses.create()`) for all OpenAI API calls
- Never use Chat Completions API (`client.chat.completions.create()`) unless Responses API is not available for the specific use case
- Use Responses API format:
  - `input`: Array with `role` and `content` (containing `input_text` and/or `input_image`)
  - `instructions`: For system prompts
  - `model`: Specify the model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
  - For images: Use `type: 'input_image'` with `image_url` (base64 data URL) and `detail: 'high'`
- For structured outputs: Parse `output_text` as JSON and validate with Zod schemas
